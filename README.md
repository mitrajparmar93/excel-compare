2. **Edit the script**:
   - Modify the `DIRECTORY` and `LOCAL_FILE` variables in `excel_comparison/compare.py` to point to the correct paths where your files are located.

## Usage

### Running the Script with a Shortcut

1. **Create a `.bat` file** in the project directory:

   - Create a `run_comparison.bat` file with the following content:

   ```batch
   @echo off
   cd path\to\your\project
   poetry run python excel_comparison/compare.py
   pause
   ```

   - Replace `path\to\your\project` with the actual path to your project directory.

1. **Create a Windows shortcut**:

   - Right-click the `.bat` file and select "Create shortcut."
   - Rename and place the shortcut wherever itâ€™s convenient (e.g., Desktop).

1. **Run the script**:
   - Double-click the shortcut to execute the script. The script will automatically find the latest Excel file in the specified directory, compare it with your local file, update the local file with any new data, and highlight the changes.

## Customization

- **File Extension**: The script is set to find files with the `.xlsx` extension. Modify the `extension` variable in the `get_latest_file` function if you need to handle other file types.
- **Highlight Color**: The script highlights new rows in yellow by default. You can change the `PatternFill` color in the script if needed.
